# Email Automation

This repository provides a basic example of automating email workflows using Python and a minimal front-end interface. Originally it only created Gmail drafts from a CSV file, but it has been extended to optionally send the emails directly via SMTP. A simple React based page allows importing the CSV file, uploading it to the backend and either creating drafts or sending the emails in order.
