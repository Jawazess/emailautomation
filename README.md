# Email Automation

This repository provides a basic example of automating the creation of email drafts using Python and a minimal front-end interface. It demonstrates how to read recipient details from a CSV file and create draft emails with attachments via Gmail's IMAP server. A simple HTML page built with React from a CDN allows importing the CSV file and triggering draft creation through an API.
